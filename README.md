# ZMK config

This is my personal config for a Cradio keyboard running ZMK firmware. It's based on manna-harbour's miryoku.

miryoku: https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku

## Design decisions

Most design principles are shared with miryoky. Here are the main changes:

- Shifted symbols are in the same position as their unshifted counterparts, to make it easier to switch to occational use on normal keyboards
- Found the third thumb key unnecessary, more comfortable to put the keys on layers
- Have only one way of doing things to train muscle memory, no special keys for shortcuts
